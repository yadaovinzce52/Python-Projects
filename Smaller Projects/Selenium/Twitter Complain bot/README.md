This is a simple project using Selenium and Python that will calculate the users internet speed, login to Twitter/X,
and write a post stating "Why is my internet speed ____ when I paid for ___".
This was a small project done to practice the basic usages of Python Selenium and automation.

Was not able to upload a zip file but the project can be found here:
